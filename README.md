### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computational biologist (and data scientist) with a passion for impactful, replicable, and understandable scientific solutions. I specialise in tools for simulating biological concepts and statistical analyses of biological datasets.

Latest Accomplishments:
- **LatticePy** - A scalable and replicable package for simulating biomolecules on a lattice.
- **Ribolog** - The only end-to-end tool for the analysis of Ribosome Profiling Data.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a 2nd year PhD Student in Quantitative and Computational Biology at Princeton University.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Biophysics, Soft Matter Mechanics, and Structural Biology.
- :notebook: I am proficienct in Python (+ Flask/ Django), R (+ RShiny), Matlab, Mathematica and Web Development (HTML, CSS, JS).
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking to learn more about protein folding and protein language models.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Protein folding, Conformational Structures, Machine Learning and Protein Language Models.
